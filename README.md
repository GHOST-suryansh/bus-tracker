# Bus Tracker Web App

Bus Tracker is a web-based application inspired by the "Where Is My Train" concept.  
The goal of this project is to track buses and provide relevant travel-related information in a simple and user-friendly way.

This project was built as a learning-focused yet large-scale web app, consisting of approximately 1300 lines of code.

---

## Project Overview

Bus Tracker helps users:
- Track buses in real time or near real time
- View bus-related information in one place
- Understand how tracking-based systems work from a front-end perspective

The project focuses on logic handling, UI structure, and managing a relatively large codebase.

## Key Features

- Bus tracking based on route or bus details  
- Structured and modular codebase  
- Clean and readable UI  
- Handles multiple states and user inputs  
- Inspired by real-world transport tracking applications  

---

## Technologies Used

- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  

(No backend used / frontend-focused project)

---

## Codebase Details

- Total code size: ~1300 lines  
- Focus on logic clarity and structure  
- Written as a learning-heavy project to understand larger web apps  

This project helped in understanding how real-world apps manage data flow, UI updates, and user interactions.

## Project Purpose

The main purpose of this project was:
- To understand how tracking applications work  
- To gain experience working with a large codebase  
- To improve JavaScript logic and UI handling  
- To build a real-world inspired web application  

---

## Limitations

- This is a learning project  
- Accuracy may not match production-level tracking apps  
- Some features may be basic or simulated  

---

## Future Improvements

- Improve tracking accuracy  
- Add backend or API integration  
- Optimize performance  
- Improve UI and responsiveness
